## Changelog
[2022-03-07] `PDV` v0.1.0 is released.

## Model Zoo

### KITTI 3D Object Detection Baselines
Selected supported methods are shown in the below table. The results are the 3D detection performance of moderate difficulty on the *val* set of KITTI dataset.
* All models are trained with 2 NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs and are available for download.
* The training time is measured with 2 NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs and PyTorch 1.7.

### Waymo Open Dataset Baselines
We could not provide the above pretrained models due to [Waymo Dataset License Agreement](https://waymo.com/open/terms/),
but you could easily achieve similar performance by training with the default configs. PDV is trained with **10% data (~16k frames)** on 4 NVIDIA Tesla V100s GPUs.


## Installation
Please refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for the installation of `OpenPCDet`.


## Quick Demo
Please refer to [DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md) for a quick demo to test with a pretrained model and
visualize the predicted results on your custom data or the original KITTI data.

## Getting Started
Please refer to [GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) to learn more usage about this project.

## License
`PDV` is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).

## Acknowledgement
We would like to thank the authors of [`OpenPCDet`](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet) for their open source release of their codebase.
